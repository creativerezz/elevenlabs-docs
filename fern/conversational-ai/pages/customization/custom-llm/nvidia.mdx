## Overview

[NVIDIA Discover](https://build.nvidia.com/) provides access to state-of-the-art language models through their API platform, allowing you to integrate powerful AI models into your ElevenLabs Conversational AI agents.

Use leading models like Gemma and others as the brain for your ElevenLabs Conversational AI agents in a few easy steps.

## Choosing a model

To make use of the full power of ElevenLabs Conversational AI you need to use a model that supports tool use and structured outputs. NVIDIA AI Foundation offers several models, including:

- google/gemma-3-1b-it
- google/gemma-7b-it
- mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1

For optimal performance with ElevenLabs Conversational AI, we recommend using `google/gemma-3-1b-it` for its balance of capabilities and performance.

## Set up Gemma hosted by NVIDIA

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Obtain your API key from the NVIDIA platform, for example on the [gemma model page](https://build.nvidia.com/google/gemma-3-1b-it).

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Once you have your API key, you can test it by running the following curl command:

    ```bash
    curl https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer API_KEY" \
      -d '{
        "model": "google/gemma-3-1b-it",
        "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Hello, how are you?"}],
        "temperature": 0.1,
        "top_p": 0.9,
        "max_tokens": 512,
        "stream": true
      }'
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Navigate to your [AI Agent](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai), scroll down to the "Secrets" section and select "Add Secret". After adding the secret, make sure to hit "Save" to make the secret available to your agent.
