key points to include
a key need for conversational ai is to define what a success/failure case looks like
we allow for structured evaluation of a call's failure or success
an evaluation criteria should evaluate to true/false, if any evaluates to false we consider the call failed 
the data is sent in the post call webhook (link to post call webhook) and is included in the get agentx

mention how the evaluation has context of rag and tools output as well as the transcript of the call
