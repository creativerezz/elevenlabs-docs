For teams that want to collaborate in ElevenLabs, we offer shared workspaces. Workspaces offer 4 benefits:

#### Shared Billing

Rather than having each of your team members individually create & manage subscriptions, all of your team’s character usage and billing is centralized under one workspace.

#### Shared resources

Within a workspace, your team can share custom voices and soon will be able to share Projects and Dubbing Studio instances.

#### Access management

Your workspace admin can easily add and remove team members.

#### API Key management

You can issue and revoke unlimited API keys for your team.

## Creating a Workspace

Workspaces are automatically enabled for all Enterprise clients. When setting up your account, you’ll be asked to nominate a workspace admin who will have the power to add more team members as well as nominate others to be an admin.

## Adding team members

<Info> Only admins can add and remove team members. </Info>

To access your workspace settings, select your profile in the bottom left of the dashboard and choose Workspace Settings.

# TODO: replace image../product/workspace/images/home_page.webp" />

You’ll be greeted with a model (shown below) where you can add team members via email and specify whether they should be a Member or Admin. We describe the different roles below.

# TODO: replace image../product/workspace/images/add_team.webp" />

## Roles

There are two roles, Admins and Members. Members have full access to your workspace and can generate an unlimited number of characters (within your current overall plan’s limit).

Admins have all of the access of Members, with the added ability to add / remove teammates and permissions to manage your subscription.

## Managing Billing

<Info> Only admins can manage billing. </Info>

To manage your billing, select your profile in the bottom left of the dashboard and choose Subscription. From there, you’ll be able to update your payment information and access past invoices.

## Managing API Keys

To manage your API keys, select your profile in the bottom left of the dashboard and choose Workspace Settings. From there you’ll be able to issue & revoke API keys.

Workspaces in ElevenLabs are designed to facilitate collaboration, organization, and governance for Enterprise teams. Once you have been upgraded to Enterprise, your administrator will automatically be granted admin permissions for your workspace.

To get started with your workspace:

- Click on your User Profile at the bottom left of your screen and select Workspace Settings.
  - Here you are able to change the name of your workspace
  - See how many seats and Professional Voice Clones (PVCs) you have associated with your workspace
  - And most importantly add and remove members and select the type of user you would like them to be

<Note>
  **Important**: you are currently only able to invite users that do not have an ElevenLabs account
  already, please reach out to success@elevenlabs.io if you are attempting to add someone with an
  account
</Note>
- Next click on your User Profile again and click on Subscription to view your subscription details
and track your usage. Keep an eye on your usage, and if you are worried you might be going over your
current Tier, we strongly recommend enabling usage-based billing. This will enable you to exceed the
allocated quota and, more importantly, prevent your account from being blocked if the character
quota is reached.
